					// access rights "RWED"), 0x0111 (PASSWORD /D for access rights "RW?-"), 0x0555
					// (PASSWORD /W for access rights "R-?-") and 0x0DDD (PASSWORD /R for files or
					// PASSWORD /P for directories for access rights "--?-"). Bits 1, 5, 9, 12-15
					// will be preserved when changing access rights. If execute bits are set on
					// systems other than FlexOS, 4680 OS or 4690 OS, they will be treated similar
					// to read bits. (Some versions of PASSWORD allow to set passwords on volume
					// labels (PASSWORD /V) as well.)
					//
					// Single-user systems calculate the most restrictive rights of the three sets
					// (DR DOS up to 5.0 used bits 0-3 only) and check if any of the requested file
					// access types requires a permission and if a file password is stored. If not,
					// file access is granted. Otherwise the stored password is checked against an
					// optional global password provided by the operating system and an optional file
					// password provided as part of the filename separated by a semicolon (not under
					// FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS). If neither of them is provided, the request will
					// fail. If one of them matches, the system will grant access (within the limits
					// of the normal file attributes, that is, a read-only file can still not be
					// opened for write this way), otherwise fail the request.
					//
					// Under FlexOS, 4680 OS and 4690 OS the system assigns group and user IDs to
					// applications when launched. When they request file access, their group and
					// user IDs are compared with the group and user IDs of the file to be opened.
					// If both IDs match, the application will be treated as file owner. If only the
					// group ID matches, the operating system will grant group access to the
					// application, and if the group ID does not match as well, it will grant world
					// access. If an application's group ID and user ID are both 0, the operating
					// system will bypass security checking. Once the permission class has been
					// determined, the operating system will check if any of the access types of the
					// requested file operation requires a permission according to the stored
					// bitflags of the selected class owner, group or world in the file's directory
					// entry. Owner, group and world access rights are independent and do not need to
					// have diminishing access levels. Only, if none of the requested access types
					// require a permission, the operating system will grant access, otherwise it
					// fails.
					//
					// If multiuser file / directory password security is enabled the system will not
					// fail at this stage but perform the password checking mechanism for the
					// selected permission class similar to the procedure described above. With
					// multi-user security loaded many utilities since DR DOS 6.0 will provide an

					// protection for password protected files, directories (or volume labels) under
					// DR DOS 3.31 and higher, including PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS, and under
					// FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager, and
					// REAL/32.
					//
					// Typical values stored on a single-user system are 0x0000 (PASSWORD /N for all
					// access rights "RWED"), 0x0111 (PASSWORD /D for access rights "RW?-"), 0x0555
					// (PASSWORD /W for access rights "R-?-") and 0x0DDD (PASSWORD /R for files or
					// PASSWORD /P for directories for access rights "--?-"). Bits 1, 5, 9, 12-15
					// will be preserved when changing access rights. If execute bits are set on
					// systems other than FlexOS, 4680 OS or 4690 OS, they will be treated similar
					// to read bits. (Some versions of PASSWORD allow to set passwords on volume
					// labels (PASSWORD /V) as well.)
					//
					// Single-user systems calculate the most restrictive rights of the three sets
					// (DR DOS up to 5.0 used bits 0-3 only) and check if any of the requested file
					// access types requires a permission and if a file password is stored. If not,
					// file access is granted. Otherwise the stored password is checked against an
					// optional global password provided by the operating system and an optional file
					// password provided as part of the filename separated by a semicolon (not under
					// FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS). If neither of them is provided, the request will
					// fail. If one of them matches, the system will grant access (within the limits
					// of the normal file attributes, that is, a read-only file can still not be
					// opened for write this way), otherwise fail the request.
					//
					// Under FlexOS, 4680 OS and 4690 OS the system assigns group and user IDs to
					// applications when launched. When they request file access, their group and
					// user IDs are compared with the group and user IDs of the file to be opened.
					// If both IDs match, the application will be treated as file owner. If only the
					// group ID matches, the operating system will grant group access to the
					// application, and if the group ID does not match as well, it will grant world
					// access. If an application's group ID and user ID are both 0, the operating
					// system will bypass security checking. Once the permission class has been
					// determined, the operating system will check if any of the access types of the
					// requested file operation requires a permission according to the stored
					// bitflags of the selected class owner, group or world in the file's directory
					// entry. Owner, group and world access rights are independent and do not need to
					// have diminishing access levels. Only, if none of the requested access types
					// require a permission, the operating system will grant access, otherwise it
					// fails.
					//
					// If multiuser file / directory password security is enabled the system will not
					// fail at this stage but perform the password checking mechanism for the
					// selected permission class similar to the procedure described above. With
					// multi-user security loaded many utilities since DR DOS 6.0 will provide an
					// additional /U:name parameter.
